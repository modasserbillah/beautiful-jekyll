# Fiqh of Interactions(Hanafi)::Class-1



- Islam has 5 branches:
	- Beliefs (Aqeedah)
	- Worship (Ibadah)
	- Transactions (Mu'amalah)
	- Relationships (Mu'asharah)
	- Character and Manners (Akhlaq and Adaab)

 ### Slaughtering Animals

 - 4 things to consider:
	 - Religion of the actor
		 - Must be muslim or people of the book.
		 - Should verify the process in case of people of the book.
		 - In a muslim majority country, meat can be accepted as halaal by default.
		 - In other places, the process should be verified.
	 - Mention of the name of Allah
		 - Obligatory in all madhabs except Shafi, they consider the omission of it makruh.
		 - In case of forgetfulness, hanafi madhab rules it halaal if the actor is muslim.
	 - The cut
		 - The sunnah: 4 things to cut
		 - Esophagus (Food pipe)
		 - Trachea (Wind pipe)
		 - Jugular vein
		 - Carotid artery
		 - According to hanafi madhab, if 3 out of 4 is cut then it's halaal.
		 - This is Imam Abu Hanifa's opinion.
		 - The principle is, majority takes the ruling of the whole thing.
		 - Imam Abu Hanifa says, any of the 3, the _sahibayn_ (Imam Abu Hanifa's students) says, it must be Esophagus, Trachea and any of the other two.
		 - Imam Malik says, Trachea and both blood vessels must be cut.
		 - Imam Shafi says, Esophagus and Trachea must be cut. Bleeding out is a fringe benefit, the killing has to be as painless as possible.
		 - Imam Ahmad has 2 opinions. One is  all four everytime and the other is similar to Imam Shafi.
		 - Can not use tooth or fingernails to cut. Any other sharp tool that makes the blood gush out.
		 - Beheading and cutting the spinal cord that causes spinal fluid to release is makruh.
		 - If slaughtered from the back, the 4 necessary cuts must be made while the animal is alive. If it is dead because of the spinal cord being cut, then it is not halaal anymore.
		 - For camels, _nahr_ is sunnah and slaughtering is makruh, the opposite is true for cows, goats, etc.
