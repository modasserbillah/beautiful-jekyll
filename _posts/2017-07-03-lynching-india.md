Communal tensions are on the rise in India since Modi's ascension to power. Brutal attacks on muslims for petty reasons are breaking out around the country. In an attempt to present the sad state of affairs more visually, I have collected data for the past 3 years that have been reported in the media. Then I geocoded it and plotted on an interactive map using the Dash library by plotly that leverages the power of python and react together. Moving the mouse over each marker in the map reveals more data and a relevant news source related to a particular event.
