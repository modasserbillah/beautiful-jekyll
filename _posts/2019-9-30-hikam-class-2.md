## Sins, passions and Repentance

> ### Hikam#13:  How can the heart be illumined while the forms of creatures are reflected in its mirror?...


- Obstacles that prevent the dhikr of Allah to enter the heart:
	- Intense focus on material things.
		- Cure: loss of those things.
		- Love your loved ones with a reasonable love. One day he might end up being your enemy. One day you're gonna separate anyway.
		- Actionable advice: attend janazas and burials.
		- Sign of treatment being complete: despairing on the piece of dunya to have it again. This is the first sign that you're getting over it.
		- Despair from the worldly element of it is _mahmud_ (praiseworthy)
		- Despair out of one's laziness is a flaw.
		- Fatalism is when you don't do your job properly and cloak it with reliance upon Allah.
		- Having a home is wajib, having a big home is sunnah.
		- Don't be a push over out of a misunderstaning of _tasawwuf_.
		- Have a strong will in matters that Allah has ordered or encouraged.
		- If the only way to get something is through haraam means, then it's a sign that Allah doesn't want you to have it.
		- You make one bad decision and generations suffer from it afterwards.

>### ...Or how can it journey to Allah while shackled by its passions?...

-  Passions are:
	-  Food
	-  Opposite gender
	-  Knowledge
	-  Wealth
	-  Power
	-  To take actions
	-  Reputation/To be known for doing
-  All the passions can be channeled for good.
-  Every passion is like an animal. No animal is inherently bad but it has to be in the right place in the ecosystem.
-  Home of sickness is the stomach. - Rasulullah &#xFDFA;
-  All envy is bad except for two things. The person who has knowledge and does good with it and the rich person who does good with his wealth. - Rasulullah &#xFDFA;
- Bad envy: you want your competitor to collapse.
- Good envy: you want to be as good as (or better than) your competitor.
- The error of the subordinate is the blame of the superior.
- It's the leader's job to oversee his subordinates.
- What is the sign that you are controlled by your desires?
	- If you're willing to do haraam to fulfil your desires then you're controlled by your desires.
	- If you're mood is altered at the point you're supposed to stop then you're excessively attached. This is not an obstruction but a weight on your back that will slow down your spiritual progress.
	- The sign of arriving at the pleasure of Allah truly is that your shukr and state is one and the same when both some one comes to take or give you something of the dunya. - Hasan al Basri &#x613;

>### ...Or how can it desire to enter the Presence of God while it has not yet purified itself of the stain of forgetfulness?...

- Greatest _ghaflah_ (forgetfulness) is leaving prayers.
- Mention Allah's name in gatherings. Just phrases like _Subhanallah_, _Alhamdulillah_, etc are okay. No need to turn every conversation into a religious conversation.
- Be cautious of using the phrase, _for the sake of Allah_.
- Do something you enjoy knowing it's halaal and thank Allah at the end of it.

> ### ...Or how can it understand the subtle points of mysteries while it has not yet repented of its offences?

- Allah will not open the doors to His subtle wisdoms and secrets except to the _Tawwabin_ (those who repent).

> ### Hikam#50: There is no minor sin when His justice confronts you; and there is no major sin when His grace confronts you.

- In fiqhi discussions sins are categorized as:
	- _Mubiqat_ - Deadly sins
	- _Kabair_ - Major sins
	- _Saghair_- Minor sins
- But do not take them lightly after knowing the categories.
- The sahaba never differentiated between obligation and sunnah.
- Knowing the difference between fard and sunnah is important.
- The christians went astray because of not knowing it.
- If you love Allah, you will stay away even from makruh, but when giving a ruling it is different.
- The sins of a mu'min will never outweigh the mercy of Allah.
- If you're penitent, then Allah is forgiving.

>### Hikmah#148: When a sin is committed by you do not let it make you despair of attaining uprightness with your Lord, for that one may be the last ever destined for you to commit.

- Umar &#x613; was an idol worshipper and went on to became the second khalifah and part of ahl al bait ( by marrying Ali's &#x613; daughter).

## QA
- How do we know about imbalance of the passions?
	- If you're ready to disobey the limits set by Allah to follow one of your passions, you have an imbalance. Dhikrullah is the cure.
- How to lose attachments to material things besides attending janazahs?
	- Sadaqah. Give away your stuff regularly. You don't have to give away your best things, old things that are still useful will suffice. You should have the mindset that my stuff can be given away. You should be bleeding charity at all times.
- How to fight laziness?
	- With force and will power. Patience and mujahada.
- How to balance between having a good opinion of Allah and falling into sins again and again?
	- Do not make pre-planned tawbahs.
	- Have good opinion in the way that Allah has kept his doors of tawbah open to you even after commiting the sin.
- How to deal with the passion of getting known for actions?
	- If you're put in a position of action, then do it and don't desire inaction.
	- If you're put in a position of inaction (sick, poor, imprisoned, etc) , then focus on worship and don't seek action because it's a passion for you. If you desire action from this position that is lowly.
