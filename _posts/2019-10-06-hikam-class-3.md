## Review

- The beginning of spiritual journey involves removing certain practices that cause haziness in your heart, e.g:
	- Separating knowledge from action.
	- This is a grave disrespect of Allah and his messenger &#xfdfa;
	- Sadness is condemned in every place it is mentioned in the Quran.
	- What’s the difference between good fear and bad fear?
		- If a fear paralyses you and pushes you to inaction, then that’s bad fear.
		- If a fear energizes you and mobilises you, then it’s a good fear.

## Chapter: Sincerity

> ### Hikam#10: Actions are lifeless forms, but the presence of an inner reality of sincerity (sirr al-ikhlāṣ) within them is what endows them with life-giving Spirit.

- Acts without sincerity are like dead bodies without soul.
- Rows, straight lines represent reason and intellect.
- Acting with sincerity doesn’t mean there should be no system or discipline, rather quite the opposite.
- For example, times for prayers are fixed.
- The best actions that Allah loves are disciplined consistent systematic ones.

> ### Hikam#20 :
> Hardly does the intention of the initiate
want to stop at what has been revealed to him,
than the voices of Reality call out to him:
“at which you are looking for is still ahead of you.” And hardly to the exterior aspects of created beings display their charms,
than their inner realities call out to him:
“We are only a trial, so disbelieve not.”

- The first benefit of spirituality is _sakinah_, peace and tranquility of the heart.
- The second benefit is the beautification of the face.
- The third benefit is seeing good dreams.
- The fourth benefit is _karamah_, things that you talk about happens. Whenever this happens, do not let it distract you. It’s a test for you.
- _Istiqamah_ (consistency) is the greatest _karamah_.
- Spirituality has its pitfalls.
- You need to be firmly grounded in _shariah_ before delving into _tasawwuf_.

> Hikam#42:\
> Travel not from creature to creature,\
otherwise you will be like a donkey at the mill:\
Roundabout he turns, his goal the same as his departure.\
Rather, go from creatures to the Creator:\
“And that the final end is unto thy Lord.”\
Consider the Prophet’s &#xfdfa; words\
“Therefore, he whose flight is for God and His Messenger,\
then his flight is for God and His Messenger;\
and he whose flight is for worldly gain\
or marriage with a woman\
then his flight is for that which he flees to.”\
So understand his words &#xfdfa;\
and ponder this matter, if you can.\
And peace on you!\

- What’s exciting is not the goal, what pleases Allah is.
- Be a people of duties, disciplines and obligations, not pleasure seekers.
- The sign of true sincerity is consistency through thick and thin.

> ### Hikam#58
> Let not obedience make you joyous because it comes from you;\
but rather, be joyous over it\
because it comes from God to you.\
“Say: In the grace of God and in His mercy,\
in that they should rejoice.\
It is better than that which they hoard.”

- _Lost during loss of transmission_

> ### Hikam#51
> No deed is more fruitful for the heart than the one you are not aware of and which is deemed paltry by you.

> ### Hikam#89
> Our Lord is far above the servant\
> dealing with Him in cash, and His repaying him in credit.

- Do not think you will only be rewarded in the hereafter.
- Allah’s rewards start from this life and extend to the hereafter.
- If drugs and alcohols are forbidden in a community, problems drop in half, that’s a reward within itself.

> ### Hikam#90
> It is reward enough for worship that He has accepted you as worthy of it.

- Stay consistent in the worship and practices and that will keep pushing the ummah through.

### QA
- What if you fear mixing of intentions?
	- Add both intentions and be explicit about it.
- Is the act invalid if you feel lack of sincerity?
	-  No, it is not.
- Should you abandon the act if you don’t feel sincere?
	- No, you go ahead with the act and try to rectify your intention.
- How to deal with mistakes in the past?
	- Past catches up with us as problems. The sign that you’re rectifying your act is that you persevere with the problems that your past bring up. Don’t take it as a punishment but as a challenge.
