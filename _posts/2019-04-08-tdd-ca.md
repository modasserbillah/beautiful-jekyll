Recently I came across a book on clean architecture focusing on Python. I was looking for something like this and got it on Leanpub for free. You can get the book from [here](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python). What follows is a bullet point list of notes I made while reading the book.

TDD
1. Test first, code later.
2. Add reasonably minimum amount of code to pass tests.
3. Shouldn't have >1 test failing at a time.   
4. Write code that passes the test, then refactor it.
5. A new test must fail first. If it doesn't, ask why add it then?   
6. Never refactor without tests.

How many assertions?
- If the test is a logical AND between condition,  use multiple assertions (eg, positive even number) and if it's a logical OR then write multiple tests.  
Testing bugs and feature requests
* Write tests first to reproduce the bug. If there is no failed test there is no bug.
* First make sure the bug is not related to environments.
Clean Architecture
* Clean is Layered
* Spherical in shape
* Inner layers are more abstract
* Layers:
    * Entities
    * Use Cases
    * External Systems
* Interaction between layers:
    * Outer -> Inner = Simple Data Structures
    * Inner -> Outer = Through Interfaces/APIs
* General workflow to plug the architecture in any external system:
    * Initialise the repo.
    * Initialise the use case.
    * Collect the results.
