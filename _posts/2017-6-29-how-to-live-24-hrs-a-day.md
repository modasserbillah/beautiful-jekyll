I was recently reading Arnold Bennett's classic book [_How to Live 24 Hours a Day_](https://amzn.to/2qgDUR6). The fact that the book is still in publication after being first published in 1908 speaks for itself. It's a short and concise read and contains timeless advices that are still applicable, in fact, even more so in our times. Here's my notes from the reading.

* Use time commuting to work for concentration exercise focusing on a specific topic.
* Conducts according to principals leads to happiness not pleasure or wealth. Example: Take the case of burglars and martyrs for example. Both involve risk and violence but not viewed as the same by the actors or others. You may become rich by looting people's homes, but happy? Well, the author doubts it and so do I.
* Reflection on conducts and principles commuting back to home.
* Having an evening program for at least 90 minutes thrice a week. Use this time box to learn something new, be it hobby or work.
* Fixing a topic to work on and focus.
* Have deliberate breaks between programs.
* Going slow is key, do not overdo it. Learning is most effective when it is deliberate, slow and consistent.
* Pitfalls: burning out, being too strict, fear of failure, being a prig.
* Have a good morning/bedtime routine in place to get things moving.

If you like what you read, I'd highly recommend you read the full book. You can get it from amazon [here](https://amzn.to/2qgDUR6)
