# Hikam::Class-4

> ### Hikmah#91
> #### Reward enough for workers is what He disclosed unto their hearts in His worship, and that which He shows them of His kindliness.

- _Jazaa_ => Compensation
	- This is for everyone according to their deed.
- _Sawab_ => Reward
	- This is compensation with more than what is deserved and _rida_ of Allah.
	- This is exclusive for muslims.
- _Mawarid_ => ?
- _Uns_ => People who are flagrant with sins get deprived from this.
	- This causes _ibadah_ to feel dry and soulless.
	- This can be due a wrong belief one takes up.
	- Or due to a sin.

> ### Hikmah#92
> #### Whoever worships Him for something they hope from Him, or obeys Him to keep chastisement from coming to themselves, has not given His attributes their due.

- But it’s okay to worship Him for something or fearing punishment.
- It’s a higher station to worship Allah because of Him being the God.
- Fear the punishment because Allah told us to fear it.
- Desire the rewards because Allah told us to desire it.
- Because Allah is giving it.
- Do not say, I don’t need the reward because that’s disrespecting Allah’s command.
- Doing _good for the sake of good_ is not scalable.
	- It stops at the point of self-harm.
	- Religion compensates for self-harm with the rewards of the afterlife.
	- Allah uses this in Quran as well saying what the enemy fights for is not the same as what the muslims stand to gain.

> ### Hikmah#121
> #### When you seek recompense for a deed,
the reality of sincerity in it is demanded of you in return.
As for the insincere,
the feeling of security from chastisement suffices him.

- Whenever you make a trade with Allah, your sincerity will be checked.
- Allah checks our deeds for 2 things:
	- Accuracy according to the sunnah. (_Ittiba us sunnah_)
	- Sincerity (_Ikhlas_)
- There are 2 types of issues with people:
	- _Ghulu_: Too strict, they narrow down the sunnah and make it hard to follow.
	- _Leen_: Too lax, they think sincerity is all you need, _ittiba_ is not important.
- If you are insincere and not fearful of the punishment, then that in itself is a punishment.
- No people will rule by anything other than my sunnah except that they are struck by division amongst them. - Rasulullah &#xfdfa;
- Whenever someone does not believe the threats from Allah and doesn’t fear them, that becomes his worst punishment in this world.

> ### Hikmah#122
> #### Do not seek recompense for a deed whose doer was not you. It suffices you as recompense for the deed that He accepts it.

- Do not credit yourself for the acts of worship you do. Rather Allah enabled, nay rewarded you with the privilege to do it.

> ### Hikmah#132
> ####  You are more in need of His forbearance when you obey Him than you are when you disobey Him.

- _Hilm_ => Slowness to anger.
- When you do good, you represent goodness in the eyes of the sinner. So, now if you mess up, you have misrepresented your God and your prophet.
- Whereas in the case of a sinner, it’s only on himself. Everyone deems him to be a sinner anyway.
- Do not be distracted by the gift over the gift-giver.
- Your first test is your attempt to prove yourself to your lord.
- Your second test is the reward He gives you. It could be fame, praise, money, spirituality, anything.
- Fear the _firasah_ of the believer because he sees with the sight of Allah.
- When Allah gifts you, He gifts you with power, wealth, knowledge, fame, spirituality but all of them bring tests with them.
- Forget your successes very quickly.
- If you can’t forget it, the cure is to keep company with the blue collar muslim => average pious muslims => the people you find in the masjid at Fajr and Esha.

> ### Hikmah#160
> #### Perhaps showing off in good works has entered upon you from where people do not see you.

- _Riya_ can be as subtle as a small black ant on a black rock on a dark night.
- Ask Allah for removing _Riya_.
- _Fee khayr wa lutf wa ‘aafiya_ : make duas like that with this phrase, so that Allah makes the process easy for you.

> ### Hikmah#161
> #### Your wanting people to know your specialness is a proof for your lack of truthfulness in your slavehood.

 - If you want people to know _I’m this , I’m that_ , then this indicates a lack of sincerity in you. But this is regarding worship and work for Allah, not professional work or career.
 - Don’t confuse this with worldly affairs.

> ### Hikmah#162
> #### Vanish from sight the eyes of people on you with the eye of God on you. And be absent from their coming towards you by seeing God approaching you.

### QA
- What if somebody worships Allah regardless of punishment or reward?
	- If the reward and punishment in question is from Allah, then make yourself desire/fear it, because it is from Allah.
	- Never feel or believe that you are not going to be punished by Allah.
	- Spread desire and fear in the right way.
- How do you get the desire of being known out of your heart?
	- Stop talking about things that can make you known.
- How to deal with the bad feeling when you’re overlooked for a position?
	- The ummah did not stop with you not getting that job. Tell yourself that you’re not important. Getting the job done is.
	- Have a positive attitude towards life.
- Are _dhati_ and _salbi_ attributes of Allah the same thing?
	- Yes, but there wordings are different.
	- _Salbi_ attributes are 5, they are mentioned in surah ikhlas.
		- These attributes are expressed with the absence of a thing.
		- _Ahad_ => He is the one ( the absence of a second)
		- _Samad_ => Independent ( the absence of needs)
		- _lam yalid wa lam yulad_ => Absence of a predecessor or successor, independent of time.
		- _lam yakullahu kufuwan ahad_ => None like unto Him, absence of any attribute that created beings possess.
- How to deal with arrogance related to worldly achievements?
	- This is less serious but still a negative.
	- First harm is that people won’t like you.
	- If you can’t cure yourself the last medicine is humiliation, failure.
	- And if you can’t check it, Allah will humiliate you in the end.
