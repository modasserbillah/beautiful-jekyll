1. Purity

    * Pure functions only operate on its input parameters.

    * No side effects.

2. Immutability

    - There are no variables in FP

    - Loops are implemented via recursion

3. Higer Order Functions

    - Higher order functions take functions as parameter or returns a function or does both.

4. Closure

    - A closure is a functions scope kept alive by a reference to that function.

5. Function Composition

    - Put together reusable functions to compose new functions.

    - More like the concept of composite function f(g(x)) from math.

6. Point Free Notation

    - In this notation, no need to specify parameters when writing functions.

7. Currying

    - A curried function is a function that takes only one parameter at a time.

    - This helps make functions more generalized for reuse.
