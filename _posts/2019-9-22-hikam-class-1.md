# Hikam::Class-1

## Chapter-1: Knowledge


- First condition for benefitting in the matters of the heart, accept the diagnosis of the scholars and don't absolve yourself saying this is not for me.
- The idea that I'm not sick is the biggest sickness and sometimes the only way out is humiliation.
- Do not accept to be humiliated.
- Ibn Ata Allah believed only in law no spirituality.
- He was one of the greatest jurists in Maliki fiqh in Alexandria, Egypt.
- Once he went to a gathering of Abul Abbas al-Morsi to renounce innovation.
- By the end of the class, he became a disciple.
- The class was about the states of the heart.
- Tasawwuf is the categorization of verses and hadith about the heart. Just like Fiqh is the categorization of verses and hadith related to the body. And Aqeeda likewise about belief.

> ### Hikam#231: Useful knowledge is that whose light rays spread in the chest and tear away the veil from the heart.

- Secular studies divorce practice from knowledge.
- Islam being treated like a dead horse. Good analogy for intellectual gymnastics.
- Islam is a lived and felt religion.
- Islam directs hate towards things and then towards people doing those things. Do you hate nazis?
- 3 signs that noor has entered your heart:
	- A great longing for spiritual matters and afterlife.
	- Loss of interest in distractions.
	- You prepare for death before it comes.

- Noor is a subtle substance that when it enters the human heart, it differentiates truth from falsehood.
- True knowledge is that which transmits noor from books/teachers to the students.

> ### Hikam#232: The best knowledge is that which is accompanied by godfearingness.

- The knowledge which removes obstacles to _khashya_ and the knowledge that helps attain _khashya_.

> ### Hikam#233: If knowledge is accompanied by godfearingness, it is for your favor, else, it is to your detriment.

- Be totally against secular studies on Islam.
- Knowledge must come with action.
- We need tough middle class muslims who are not afraid of confrontations and asserts their will.
- Signs that you love Allah:
	- You have a feeling that you love Allah.
	- You love other muslims.
	- You hate the enemies of Islam and muslims.
	- You strive for Islam.
	- You don't care about blames.

### QnA
- What is the principle for commanding the good and forbidding the evil?
	- Public Fatwa can only be given by the dominant opinion. Minority opinions can be followed individually but can not be forbidden under the pretense of forbidding the evil. There has to be ijma on it being wrong to be condemned.
- How do we achieve a pure heart after knowing it's definition?
	- A pure heart comes from actions originating from sound knowledge.
	- In sura ale-imran, crooked heart is juxtaposed with a heart rich with knowledge.
	- Biggest culprit of Islam is self study of hadiths.
- What is the difference between _khudu'a_ and _khushu'a_?
	- _khudu'a_ is humility and _khushu'a_ is humility with awe. _khushu'a_ is exclusive for Allah. Likewise _shukr_ is general and _hamd_ is exclusive for Allah.
- How do we prepare for death before it comes?
	- Rectify beliefs.
	- Establishing the prayers.
	- Rectifying matters with parents.
	- Rectifying financial matters.
- How do you strike a balance between rectifying yourself and helping others?
	- Both should be done simultaneously.
	- Helping others/ social interactions bring out issues of the heart like envy, etc. So, that's a means of purifying the heart as well.
	- Know what is required of you and don't be guilt-trapped for things outside of it.
	- A desire to do more is good but do not feel guilty.
- What should we hate?
	- _Zandaqah_ (heresey) and _bid'ah_ (innovation).
	- Enemies of muslims.
